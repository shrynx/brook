> A small stream library for using observables with reasonml.

## 🚨 Disclaimer

By no means this library provides any guarantees, as it is a project to help me or anyone who is willing to contribute, learn/explore reasonml and inner workings of observables.

## 🎯 Aim

The goal is to support a hand full of stream constructors and operators.

This library is aimed to be used only with bucklescript to generate javascript, hence won't be working for native OCaml code generation.
